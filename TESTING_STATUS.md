```

**Test Files:**
- 39 `*_test.go` files across the codebase
- Unit tests for API, monitor, alert, etcd client
- Integration test orchestrator (Python)

---

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (Go)

**Existing Coverage:**
- âœ… `pkg/monitor/alert_test.go` - Alert manager and channels
- âœ… `pkg/api/server_test.go` - API endpoints
- âœ… Kubernetes controllers
- âœ… etcd client wrappers
- âœ… Cluster providers

**Testing Frameworks:**
- `testing` (stdlib)
- `github.com/stretchr/testify`
- `github.com/golang/mock/gomock`
- `github.com/onsi/ginkgo/v2`
- `github.com/onsi/gomega`

### 2. Integration Tests (Python)

**test_comprehensive.py** orchestrates:
1. Environment setup
2. etcd server startup
3. Go dependency installation
4. Unit test execution with coverage
5. Integration tests (API endpoints)
6. Benchmark tests
7. Load tests
8. Report generation

**Test Scenarios:**
- Health endpoint validation
- Cluster status API
- Metrics endpoints
- Alert endpoints
- Performance endpoints
- Load testing (100 concurrent requests, 95% success rate)

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**Jobs:**
1. **Test Suite** - Multi-version Go testing (1.19, 1.20, 1.21)
2. **Security Scan** - gosec + govulncheck + dependency checks
3. **Build** - All binaries (monitor, controllers, examples, pingap)
4. **Docker** - Container build and validation
5. **Deploy** - Staging + production (on main branch)
6. **Notify** - Success/failure notifications

**Artifacts:**
- Coverage reports (HTML)
- Test results logs
- Built binaries
- Docker images

### 4. Pre-commit Hooks

**Hooks Configured:**
- Go formatting (`gofmt`, `goimports`)
- Linting (`go vet`, `golint`, `go-critic`)
- Unit tests (race detector enabled)
- Coverage threshold check (80%)
- Security scanning (`gosec`, `govulncheck`)
- File checks (trailing whitespace, large files, YAML/JSON validation)
- Dockerfile linting (`hadolint`)
- Markdown linting
- Conventional commit messages

## Next Steps to 100% Coverage

### Phase 1: Measurement (Current)
- [ ] Run comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Generate coverage reports
- [ ] Identify uncovered code paths
- [ ] Prioritize critical paths

### Phase 2: Fill Gaps
- [ ] Write tests for uncovered packages
- [ ] Add edge case tests
- [ ] Increase error handling tests
- [ ] Add concurrent operation tests

### Phase 3: Validation
- [ ] Verify 100% coverage achieved
- [ ] Run full integration test suite
- [ ] Perform load testing
- [ ] Security validation

### Phase 4: Maintenance
- [ ] Enforce coverage in CI/CD
- [ ] Regular security scans
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Continuous improvement

## How to Run Tests

### Run All Tests with Coverage
```bash
# Unit tests
go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -covermode=atomic ./...

# View coverage in terminal
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# Generate HTML coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html

# Open in browser
open coverage.html
```

### Run Comprehensive Test Suite
```bash
# Requires Python 3.10+, Go 1.19+, etcd installed
pip install requests pyyaml
python3 test_comprehensive.py .
```

### Run Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Setup hooks
pre-commit install

# Run manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Run Security Scans
```bash
# Install tools
go install github.com/securecodewarrior/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
go install golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck@latest

# Run scans
gosec ./...
govulncheck ./...
```

## Test Reports

### Generated Reports
- `coverage.out` - Raw coverage data
- `coverage.html` - Interactive HTML coverage report
- `test_report.json` - Comprehensive test results (Python suite)
- GitHub Actions artifacts - Per-job results and logs

### Coverage Thresholds
- **Minimum:** 80% (enforced in CI)
- **Target:** 100%
- **Current:** Run `go tool cover -func=coverage.out | grep total`

## Implementation from PRD Files

### Systems Described in PRDs
All systems from PRD files are being implemented with tests:

1. **Core Monitoring** - Health checks, metrics, alerts
2. **etcd Client** - Connection, TLS, failover
3. **API Server** - REST endpoints, WebSocket
4. **Cluster Management** - Multi-cluster support
5. **Alerting** - Email, Slack, PagerDuty, Webhook
6. **Benchmarking** - Performance testing
7. **Controllers** - Kubernetes operators

Each system has:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- API tests
- Performance tests
