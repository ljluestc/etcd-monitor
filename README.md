# etcd-monitor

A comprehensive monitoring and alerting system for etcd clusters.

## Project Structure

This repository contains:

- **PRD.md** - Complete Product Requirements Document
- **tasks.json** - Structured task breakdown parsed from the PRD
- **taskmaster.go** - CLI tool for managing task state and tracking progress
- **tasks.state.json** - Generated file tracking task state history

## TaskMaster - Task Management System

TaskMaster is a CLI tool that helps manage the project tasks, track progress, and maintain state history.

### Installation

Build the TaskMaster CLI:

```bash
go build -o taskmaster taskmaster.go
```

On Windows:
```bash
go build -o taskmaster.exe taskmaster.go
```

### Usage

#### Initialize from PRD (New!)

```bash
./taskmaster init
```

Automatically generates tasks.json from PRD.md. This parses the PRD document and creates a structured task breakdown with:
- Automatic task ID generation
- Feature-to-phase mapping
- Subtask creation from requirements
- Priority and estimation tracking

Optional parameters:
```bash
./taskmaster init [prd-file] [output-file] [project-name] [version]

# Examples:
./taskmaster init PRD.md tasks.json etcd-monitor 1.0.0
./taskmaster init custom-prd.md my-tasks.json my-project 2.0.0
```

#### View All Tasks

```bash
./taskmaster status
```

Shows all tasks organized by phase with their current status, priority, and progress.

#### View Progress Statistics

```bash
./taskmaster progress
```

Returns JSON with detailed progress metrics:
- Total tasks and completion percentage
- Tasks by status (pending, in_progress, completed, blocked)
- Subtask completion statistics

#### View Task Details

```bash
./taskmaster details task-1.1
```

Shows detailed information about a specific task including:
- Description and priority
- Estimated hours
- Assignee
- All subtasks with their status
- Timestamps (started, completed)

#### Update Task Status

```bash
./taskmaster update task-1.1 in_progress "Starting project setup"
```

Status values:
- `pending` - Not started
- `in_progress` - Currently being worked on
- `completed` - Finished
- `blocked` - Cannot proceed

#### Update Subtask Status

```bash
./taskmaster update-subtask task-1.1 task-1.1.1 completed
```

#### Assign Task

```bash
./taskmaster assign task-1.1 "John Doe"
```

#### View State History

```bash
./taskmaster history 20
```

Shows the last 20 state changes with timestamps and notes.

## Project Overview

### Summary

- **4 Phases** spanning 16 weeks
- **33 Main Tasks** with detailed requirements (including etcd operations features)
- **192 Subtasks** for granular tracking
- **560 Estimated Hours** of development work

### New Features Added

Based on etcd operations best practices, the following features have been added:

#### etcdctl Command Interface (Phase 2)
- Interactive command execution (put/get/delete/watch)
- Cluster operations (member list, endpoint health/status)
- Data operations (compaction, snapshot save/restore)
- Command history and auto-completion

#### Benchmark Testing System (Phase 2)
- Write/read performance testing
- SLI/SLO tracking (40K read ops/sec, 20K write ops/sec, <100ms latency)
- Historical benchmark results and comparison
- Performance regression detection

#### Disk Performance Testing (Phase 2)
- FIO-based disk validation
- WAL fsync performance testing
- Production readiness validation (99% fsync < 10ms)

### Phases

#### Phase 1: MVP (Weeks 1-6)
Core functionality including:
- Cluster health monitoring
- Basic metrics collection
- Email alerting
- Dashboard UI

#### Phase 2: Enhanced Monitoring (Weeks 7-10)
Advanced features:
- Multi-cluster support
- Advanced metrics
- Slack/PagerDuty integration
- RESTful API

#### Phase 3: Enterprise Features (Weeks 11-14)
Production-ready capabilities:
- RBAC and security
- Backup monitoring
- Audit logging
- Prometheus/Grafana integration

#### Phase 4: Polish and Scale (Weeks 15-16)
Final preparation:
- UI/UX improvements
- Complete documentation
- CLI tool
- Production deployment
