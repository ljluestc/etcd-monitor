## 8. Risk Assessment

### High Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Flaky tests due to timing issues | High | Use proper mocking, avoid real etcd/network deps |
| Long test execution time | Medium | Parallelize tests, optimize slow tests |
| etcd dependency for tests | High | Use embedded etcd or mocks |
| Race conditions in concurrent code | High | Always run with `-race` flag |

### Medium Risks

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Mock drift from real implementations | Medium | Sync mocks regularly, interface testing |
| Incomplete error scenario coverage | Medium | Systematic error injection testing |
| Integration test environment setup | Medium | Use docker-compose for dependencies |
