## 📋 Remaining Work

### Critical Issues (2 remaining - 8-10 hours)

#### Issue #1: pkg/patterns Timeout 🔴
**Status:** Not Fixed
**Priority:** HIGH
**Time:** 4-6 hours

**Problem:** Tests hang trying to connect to real etcd server

**Solution:** Create `testutil/mocks/etcd_client_mock.go`
```go
package mocks

import clientv3 "go.etcd.io/etcd/client/v3"

type MockEtcdClient struct {
    clientv3.Client
    // Mock methods as needed
}

func NewMockEtcdClient() *MockEtcdClient {
    return &MockEtcdClient{}
}
```

#### Issue #2: pkg/monitor Nil Logger 🟡
**Status:** Not Fixed
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Time:** 1-2 hours

**Problem:** Tests expect nil loggers to work, constructors fail

**Solution:** Use `zap.NewNop()` as default
```go
func NewAlertManager(..., logger *zap.Logger) *AlertManager {
    if logger == nil {
        logger = zap.NewNop()
    }
    // ...
}
```

#### Issue #3: pkg/api CORS Middleware 🟡
**Status:** Not Fixed
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Time:** 2-3 hours

**Problem:** OPTIONS requests return 405 instead of 200

**Solution:** Add OPTIONS handler
```go
func (s *Server) corsMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*")
        w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS")
        w.Header().Set("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Content-Type, Authorization")

        if r.Method == "OPTIONS" {
            w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
            return
        }

        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
    })
}
```

```

**Day 2-3: Fix pkg/monitor Nil Logger**
```bash
