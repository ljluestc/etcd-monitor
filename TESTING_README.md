## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run All Tests
```bash
# Easy way (recommended)
python3 test_comprehensive.py --all

# Or using Make
make test
```

### Run Specific Tests
```bash
# Unit tests only
python3 test_comprehensive.py --unit

# With race detection
python3 test_comprehensive.py --race

# Specific package
python3 test_comprehensive.py --package pkg/monitor

# Generate coverage report
python3 test_comprehensive.py --coverage
```

### View Coverage Report
```bash
# Generate HTML report
make test-coverage

# Open in browser (Linux)
xdg-open coverage/coverage.html

# Or manually open
open coverage/coverage.html
```

## 📊 Current Status

```

## 🎯 Next Steps (This Week)

### Priority 1: Fix pkg/patterns Timeout (4-6 hours)
```bash
# Create mock etcd client
nano testutil/mocks/etcd_client_mock.go

# Update patterns tests
nano pkg/patterns/patterns_test.go

# Test
go test ./pkg/patterns -v -timeout=30s
```

### Priority 2: Fix pkg/monitor Nil Logger (1-2 hours)
```bash
# Update constructors to use zap.NewNop() as default
nano pkg/monitor/service.go
nano pkg/monitor/alert.go
nano pkg/monitor/health.go

# Test
go test ./pkg/monitor -v
```

### Priority 3: Fix pkg/api CORS (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Add OPTIONS handler to CORS middleware
nano pkg/api/server.go

# Test
go test ./pkg/api -v
```
